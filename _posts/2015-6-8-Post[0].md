I realise I'm get really bored during the mornings while working, so I decided - Why not start blogging again. 8:30AM is wayyyyy too early to start coding/do research on APIs. RIP to my old wordpress though, I decided not to continue going with it as it's too.... <i>meh</i>. Hahaha. More exciting to do a plain webpage like this.

Anyways, for those who do not know yet, I am currently doing an internship at IDA over the summer before NOC. Working on the Smart Nation Project / Next-gen platform. It has been pretty interesting, learning lots and lots of technology. Will probably upload my slides/infographics/resources for readers who are interested.

Today also marks the first day of Frances's internship at [Dog Ear Books](http://www.dogearbooks.sg) . Heard about that company in passing through NOC, introduced it to her, and asked her to email them. So glad that she landed the internship! (: 

### NOC /rant

Still awaiting on my US visa to get approved, it's been almost 6 weeks. Ugh. And we have to decide on which airline to take as well. Options include:
<br>
<ul>
	<li> Korea Air ( With Gasi) :  S$1680 + S$735 = S$2415 </li>
	<li> China Airline (With Gasi): S$1530 + S$705 = s$2235 </li>
	<li> Singapore Airlines (Self booking) : S$2911 </li>
</ul>
Can't decide man, anyone with advice please reach out to me aight!
